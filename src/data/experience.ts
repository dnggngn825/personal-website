      "Re-architected a YAML-based form flow engine and Knockout.js UI into a code-driven TypeScript and Vue 3 framework, adding Playwright integration tests to validate correctness with zero regressions.",
      "Led the rollout of the migration across 41 product teams over 15+ months as the primary point of contact, triaging issues and sustaining adoption momentum across the organisation.",
      "Drove the migration of 70+ core JavaScript modules to TypeScript, improving type safety and reducing runtime errors across shared frontend surfaces.",
      "Built internal developer tooling including a Node.js process orchestrator with MCP server and CLI interfaces on an event-driven architecture, improving productivity for 200+ engineers.",
      "Replaced legacy form flow components with redesigned implementations, engineering backward compatibility validation, integration tests, and unit tests before rolling changes out safely across 30+ product teams.",
      "Owned and extended Platform Builder, a low-code CargoWise portal configuration platform, adding full-stack capabilities across Vue 3 via WebView2 and C# .NET Framework that unblocked product teams to build their own business logic without platform team involvement.",
      "Extended a localisation pipeline supporting translation of globally used CargoWise web portals into 49 languages, expanding coverage across multiple product repositories.",
      "Maintained frontend build infrastructure across multiple repositories including Vite, Rspack, and Webpack configurations, enforcing code quality and consistency through ESLint standards and Vitest/Jest test suites.",
