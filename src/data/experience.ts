      "Built and maintained a CLI tool that reads YAML-serialized form flow metadata and uses the TypeScript compiler API to resolve types and emit declaration files via module augmentation — providing end-to-end compile-time type safety between C# backend models and TypeScript form definitions.",
      "Led a repo-wide migration from YAML-based form flows to TypeScript-coded implementations — extended an AST-based parser using the TypeScript compiler API to statically extract JSDoc metadata, parameter types, and C#↔TypeScript type mappings from source files without compilation, serving the form flow pipeline used across 41 product teams.",
      "Fixed bugs and built new features in Platform Builder, a low-code platform used across CargoWise to build and configure web portal applications for end clients — working across the Vue 3 frontend and C#/.NET backend, covering UI layouts, form flows, and business rules.",
      "Maintained an internal localisation/translation pipeline integrated into an in-house CI/CD system, added support for extracting translatable strings defined in Vue files, and worked closely with the translation team to ensure it runs smoothly across repositories.",
      "Extended Glow Runner — an internal Node.js process orchestrator (TypeScript, Express, PubSub-JS) for managing parallel frontend build pipelines — by integrating new processes into the pub/sub message bus for real-time state propagation across monitoring and notification systems, and expanded pipeline coverage to the organisation's frontend product repository.",
      "Mentored junior engineers through code reviews, covering platform internals and best practices.",
      "Developed a solid understanding of engineering best practices including Agile, design patterns, and test-driven development through day-to-day work on the team.",
      "Took ownership of features end-to-end — from scoping and design through to implementation, testing, and release — with growing autonomy and reduced oversight over time.",
